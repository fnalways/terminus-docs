You can use **Terminus Space** and its related features by logging in with Terminus Space using a QR code. In the near future, you will also be able to link third-party accounts, such as **Google Account**, for synchronizing data with **Google Drive** and other services.

## Terminus Space Account

Each **Terminus Name** is associated with a **Terminus Space account**. You can log into Terminus Space using the **TermiPass** application by scanning the QR code.

Once you have logged in to **Terminus Space**, you will be able to view detailed system data information. However, if you've never logged in before, you won't be able to view this system data.

For more information, please refer to [Management Terminus](../../space/host/management-terminus.md).

### Import Blockchain Wallet

To use NFT images as unique avatars in your profile, you need to bind a blockchain wallet. You can find **MetaMask** in the **Chrome Web Store**. After installing the extension, create or import your blockchain wallet. Then, click the **'Import'** button to import your wallet.

After importing the wallet, the page will refresh to display the imported wallet fields. Now you can click the **'Bound'** button to trigger the **MetaMask** wallet authorization. Once the binding process is completed, a message will be sent to your **TermiPass** mobile app. Click **'Bound'** again to bind the wallet to your Terminus Name.
