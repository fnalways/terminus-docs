# Domain

## Using a Custom Domain with Terminus

If you're an organizational user, you might prefer your employees to use company-specific domain names for login instead of our public domain. In such cases, you can apply for your own **Domain** and bind it.

## Why can't I bind a new domain?

A new domain can only be bound if the account is in the **DID** state. If the account has already been bound with a **Terminus Name**, it means that the account is already associated with a **Domain**, so you won't be able to switch to a new one.

You can create a new DID and then use this DID to log into **Terminus Space** and set up your own **Domain**. Here are the steps:

1. Apply for a domain name on Cloud
2. Set up DNS configuration
3. Apply for an account on **TermiPass** and bind the **Domain** name
4. Apply for a **Terminus Name** under this **Domain**
5. Proceed with the installation
6. Access Terminus through the **Custom Domain**
