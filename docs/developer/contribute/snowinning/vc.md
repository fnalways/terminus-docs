# VC Service

The purpose of this documentation is to help you understand how to configure various schema and use [verifiable-credential-gate](https://github.com/Above-Os/verifiable-credential-gate) and [did-gate](https://github.com/Above-Os/did-gate) by Terminus and [SSI Service](https://github.com/TBD54566975/ssi-service) by tbd team to create Issuers and Verifiers for your own scenarios.

If you want to engage in lower-level development, read the [protocol standard](#reference) together with the source code in [SSI SDK](https://github.com/TBD54566975/ssi-sdk).

## Introduction

In [VC](../../../overview/snowinning/concepts.md#verifiable-credential) we introduced the basic process for applying VCs.

In the real communication process of Wallet, Verifier and Issuer we will see more nouns, which we go through here:

| Term                    | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Holder                  | Holders are entities that have one or more verifiable credentials in their possession. Holders are also the entities that submit proofs to Verifiers to satisfy the requirements described in a Presentation Definition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Issuer                  | A role an entity can perform by asserting claims about one or more subjects, creating a verifiable credential from these claims, and transmitting the verifiable credential to a holder.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Verifier                | Verifiers are entities that define what proofs they require from a Holder (via a Presentation Definition) in order to proceed with an interaction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Verifiable Credential   | Is a tamper-evident credential that has authorship that can be cryptographically verified. Verifiable credentials can be used to build Verifiable Presentations, which can also be cryptographically verified. The claims in a credential can be about different subjects. PEX accepts Verifiable credential in 3 forms: 1. JSON_LD which is know in our system as IVerifiableCredential, 2. JWT-Wrapped VC which is known in our system as JwtWrappedVerifiableCredential or string which is a valid Verifiable credential jwt |
| Verifiable Presentation | s a tamper-evident presentation encoded in such a way that authorship of the data can be trusted after a process of cryptographic verification.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Manifest                | Credential Manifests are used to describe which credentials are available for issuance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| Presentation Definition | Presentation Definitions are objects that articulate what proofs a Verifier requires.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

## Issuer Service

![alt text](image-1.png)

Process

1. Holder gets Manifest from Issuer
2. Holder signs by himself and submits Application
3. Issuer reviews Application automatically or manually
4. Holder gets results of Review from Issuer and get VC if passed or reason if rejected

### Manifest

This file will be returned to Holder.
The parameter `outputDescriptors` is given for wallets to display VCs.
`presentationDefinition` is in fact the later `manifest_presentation` file, used to confirm the format of Application submitted by users.

```json

            ],

  ],
  "format": {
    "jwt_vc": {
      "alg": ["EdDSA"]
    }
  },
  "presentationDefinition": {}
}
```

### Manifest Presentation

Issuer uses this file to validate the format of Application submitted by Holder.

```json
{
  "name": "Facebook Manifest Presentation Definition",
  "purpose": "Provide your token required to Facebook",
  "inputDescriptors": [
    {
      "id": "token",
      "name": "Access Token",
      "purpose": "Provide your token required to Facebook",
      "format": {
        "jwt_vc": {
          "alg": ["EdDSA"]
        }
      },
      "constraints": {
        "fields": [
          {
            "path": ["$.credentialSubject.token"]
          }
        ],
        "subject_is_issuer": "preferred"
      }
    }
  ],
  "author": ""
}
```

### Application Verifiable Credential

Although users only need `manifest_presentation` to construct VC data in client, servers need a schema to verify whether `manifest_presentation` meets the format requirements.
This file will be returned to Holder so that Holder knows the format of data required to submit for verification.
In the scenarios of Facebook, Twitter and Gmail, users login in client and get the access token, then submit it to the Issuer server, which can get the basic information of the user with the access token from e.g. the Facebook server etc. So users only need to submit the token which is simple.
But in the scenario of KYC, users need to submit full name, ID photo or even verification video etc., and the fields in this file can become much more complicated.

```json
{
  "author": "",
  "name": "Facebook Verifiable Credential Request Schema",
  "schema": {
    "$id": "facebook-schema-1.0",
    "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
    "description": "Facebook Verifiable Credential Schema",
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "token": {
        "type": "string"
      }
    },
    "required": ["token"],
    "additionalProperties": true
  },
  "sign": false
}
```

### Verifiable Credential

The VC format returned to Holder by Issuer

```json

  },
  "sign": false
}
```

## Verifer Service

Refer to [Presentation Exchange](https://identity.foundation/presentation-exchange/)
![alt text](image-2.png) for the process.

### Presentation Definition

Verifier returns the file to Holder, and Holder returns packaged Submission which meets the format requirements to Verifier after filling in the contents according to the requirements.

```json
{
  "name": "Facebook Basic Info Presentation Definition",
  "purpose": "Provide your facebook basic info",
  "inputDescriptors": [

      "name": "Name",
      "purpose": "Provide vc name",
      "format": {
