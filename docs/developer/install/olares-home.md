# Olares Home

"Olares Home" is the default installation directory for Olares. It stores images, logs, dependency components, and version management data. In this document, you will learn the structure of Olares Home and gain a clearer understanding of the Olares installation process.

## Path configuration

By default, Olares Home is located at `~/.olares`. You can customize its location using the `--base-dir` option with a specific `olares-cli` command, for example:

```bash
#  Specifies the base directory where all downloaded components will be saved
olares-cli olares download component --base-dir /custom/path
```

## Directory structure

A typical Olares Home directory might look like this:

```
./olares
├── images                # Stores downloaded image files
│   ├── {image-file}.tar.gz
│   └── {image-file}.tar.gz
├── logs                  # Stores all logs
├── pkg                   # Stores downloaded system dependency components
│   ├── cni               # Container Network Interface (K8s network plugins)
│   ├── components        # Olares foundation software dependencies (not directly related to K8s)
│   │                       such as olaresd, JuiceFS, Redis, etc.
│   ├── containerd        # Container Runtime Interface (CRI) runtime

    └── v1.10.0-20240930
        ├── cli

```

The structure of Olares Home is designed to optimize file management, version control, and resource sharing. The advantages include:  

- Each Olares version is stored under the `versions` directory. All files and logs related to a particular version are contained within its subdirectory.
- Only one Olares instance can run on a single machine at a time, preventing version conflicts.
- The `images` and `pkg` directories are shared across all Olares versions. This design reduces redundancy, minimizes duplicate downloads, and saves disk space.
