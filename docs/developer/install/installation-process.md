# Olares installation breakdown

This document explains the Olares installation process from the perspective of its four main phases. It is aimed at developers and system administrators who want to understand the installation in detail, including the underlying commands, configurations, and logic behind each phase.

## Four phases of installation
The Olares installation process is divided into four phases, each ensuring a smooth and stable setup:

- **Precheck**: Verifies that the system environment meets all prerequisites for Olares installation.
- **Download**: Retrieves all necessary files, dependencies, and container images for the installation.
- **Prepare**: Configures the operating system and system services to create an environment ready for Kubernetes and Olares components.
- **Install**: Deploys Kubernetes, integrates KubeSphere, and installs core Olares services and applications.

## Precheck phase

The precheck phase focuses on verifying that your system meets the necessary requirements for installing Olares. The `olares-cli olares precheck` command is used to run a series of validation checks. Any issues identified during this phase must be resolved before continuing with the installation.

Key checks include:
- Checks the compatibility with the operating system type, version, and CPU architecture
- Confirms that the system uses `Systemd` as its initialization process
- Ensures required ports that Olares needs to expose are available
- Verifies that no conflicting container runtime is installed

If the precheck fails, you'll see a warning like this:
 
 ![Precheck](/images/developer/install/precheck.png)

In this example:
- Port `9100` required by Olares is already in use.
- An existing container runtime is detected in the system. 

You must resolve these issues before proceeding.

## Download phase

The download phase retrieves the necessary wizard files, system dependencies, and container images required for Olares installation.


### Download the wizard file

The wizard file is a metadata package that contains download URLs and configuration details for all Olares components. It is the first file retrieved during this phase, as it provides critical information for the subsequent downloads.

By default, the wizard file is stored in:

`HOME/.olares/versions/<version>`

where:
- `$HOME/.olares` is the base directory for Olares.
- `<version>` refers to the version number of Olares (e.g. `1.12.0-20241215`).

**Example script output**:

```bash
➜  ~ ./install.sh
the KUBE_TYPE env var is not set, defaulting to "k3s
olares-cli already installed and is the expected version

```

### Download components and container images
Once the wizard file has been downloaded, the script retrieves all necessary dependencies and container images. These files are stored in:
- `$HOME/.olares/pkg` for dependency packages.
- `$HOME/.olares/image` for container images.

This storage structure allows reusing stable components across multiple versions to avoid redundant downloads.

**Example script output**:

```bash

```

## Prepare phase

The prepare phase configures the system environment to support Kubernetes, container images, and Olares services.

This phase involves three main tasks:
- Configure the system
- Set up the container runtime
- Install the system daemon

### Configure system
The installation script configures the Linux environment to meet Olares' requirements. These configurations include:
- Adjusts DNS, NTP, and SSH services to ensure proper network functionality and time synchronization.
- Installs essential dependencies (e.g., curl, net-tools, gcc, make) via `apt`.

**Example script output**:

```bash

### Set up container runtime
The container runtime is a critical component for running containerized applications. During this step, the installation script:
- Installs and start the previously downloaded dependencies
- Installs containerd on the system and start the service
- Imports the downloaded container images into containerd

**Example script output**:
  
```bash
2024-12-17T19:47:37.510+0800        [Module] InstallContainerModule(k3s)
2024-12-17T19:47:37.518+0800        [A] ubuntu: ZfsMountReset skipped (7.321811ms)

...
```

### Install system daemon
The Olares system daemon, olaresd, is then installed and started to monitor the system and automatically perform maintenance tasks.

**Example script output**:

```bash
024-12-17T19:52:31.862+0800        [A] ubuntu: GenerateOlaresdEnv success (23.829684ms)

...
```

## Install phase
The install phase brings all system components online and ensures the runtime environment is fully operational.

During this phase, the script primarily completes the following tasks:
- Deploy Kubernetes.
- Integrate KubeSphere for cloud-native management and observability.
- Configure the Olares account.
- Deploy and start built-in apps and services.

### Deploy Kubernetes

Kubernetes is the backbone of the Olares system. During this step, the installation script:
1.	Starts the etcd database.
2.	Starts and configures K3s, the default Kubernetes distribution used by Olares.
3.	Installs a Container Network Interface (CNI) plugin for cluster networking.
4.	Copies the `kubeconfig` file to the current user's directory, enabling interaction with the cluster via `kubectl`.

K3s is the default Kubernetes distribution for Olares due to its lightweight design and ease of use. However, kubernetes is also available for advanced or custom setups.

On macOS, the scripts uses Minikube, which will skip the above step.

**Example script output**:

```bash

### Integrate KubeSphere

KubeSphere is installed on top of Kubernetes to enhance system management and observability. It provides features such as:

- System monitoring and alerting.
- Resource and workspace management.
- Namespaces and custom resource definitions (CRDs).

### Configure account
The Olares ID is created on the LarePass app. During this step, the installation script prompts you to enter the following info, so you can use LarePass to activate Olares later:
- **Olares domain name**: Olares provides default names `olares.com` and `olares.cn`. This can be customized if the custom domain has been added to Olares Space.
- **Olares ID**: Enter the username part of your Olares ID. 

This creates a system account for logging in to Olares and completes several background access and permission configurations.

**Example script output:**

```bash
Enter the domain name ( olares.com by default ): olares.cn
2024-12-17T20:58:15.690+0800        using Domain Name: olares.cn

Enter the Olares ID (which you registered in the LarePass app): terminus
2024-12-17T20:58:52.584+0800        using Olares Local Name: marvin113
2024-12-17T20:58:52.584+0800        using Olares ID: marvin113@olares.com
2024-12-17T20:58:52.584+0800        using password: 2uO5PZ2X
```

### Deploy built-in applications
The final deployment step installs core services and user applications using Helm charts:
- **Core system services** (in the `os-system` namespace): Includes backups (Velero), storage (OpenEBS), Redis, Nats, MinIO, etc.
- **User applications** (in namespaces like `user-space-xxx`): Includes Files, Desktop, Settings, etc.

During installation, the log will display messages such as `[helm] app installed success` and `xxx created`, indicating that the respective Helm charts or Kubernetes resources have been installed successfully.

### Complete the installation

Once all components are deployed, the script outputs a summary with a URL for the activation wizard:

```bash
2024-12-17T21:00:58.086+0800        [INFO] Installation wizard is complete
2024-12-17T21:00:58.086+0800        [INFO] All done

------------------------------------------------

2024-12-17T21:00:58.086+0800        Olares is running at:
2024-12-17T21:00:58.086+0800        http://192.168.1.16:30180

2024-12-17T21:00:58.086+0800        Open your browser and visit the above address
2024-12-17T21:00:58.086+0800        with the following credentials:

2024-12-17T21:00:58.086+0800        Username: marvin113
2024-12-17T21:00:58.086+0800        Password: 2uO5PZ2X
```

To complete the installation, you need to:
1. Open your browser and enter the provided URL.
2. Log in to the activation wizard with initial password. 
3. Follow the on-screen prompt to finish the activation.

After activation, your Olares will be fully operational and ready to use.
