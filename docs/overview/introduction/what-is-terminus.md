# What is Terminus?

Terminus's mission is to "let people own their data again".

It provides a next-generation decentralized Internet framework based on the Blockchain-Edge-Client [(BEC)](./bec.md) architecture, consisting of three core components and a series of protocols.

## Core components
- [**Snowinning Protocol**](../snowinning/overview.md): An identity and reputation protocol that adheres to W3C standards. It is user-owned and based on blockchain smart contracts.
- [**Terminus OS**](../terminus/overview.md): A cloud-native, source-available operating system based on Kubernetes enhancements, running on user-owned edge devices.
- [**TermiPass**](../../how-to/termipass/overview.md): A client software that assists users manage on-chain identities and edge devices.
 

## Protocols

We believe that in the future decentralized world, platforms may no longer exist but protocols will remain forever. In addition to Snowinning Protocol, we also provide three protocol prototypes:

- [**Otmoic Protocol**](../protocol/otmoic.md): A protocol based on Request For Quote (RFQ) and on-chain reputation to provide prices and exchange values for public goods.
- [**Market Protocol**](../protocol/market.md): A permissionless app distribution protocol that eliminates the need for stringent reviews and commissions by intermediaries like Apple.
- [**Recommend Protocol**](../protocol/recommend.md): A decentralized and privacy-protecting information distribution protocol designed to free you from the information bubble.
 
Terminus derives its name from Isaac Asimov's book *Foundation*. In the story, Terminus is a planet at the edge of the galaxy where scientists compile the *Encyclopedia* to record all human knowledge from the past thousand years. This aligns with our vision: **allowing every individual, family, and business to document their unique journey through their own Terminus in the future**.

## Use Cases

- **Self-Hosted**

  We aim to make Terminus a one-stop self-hosted solution.

  For the past two years, we have drawn inspiration from the [`/r/SelfHosted/`](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/) community. Terminus is our gift to you, born from this inspiration.

- **Local AI**

  In an era where privacy is increasingly valued, the [AI Framework](../terminus/ai.md) provided by Terminus helps users build local agents without needing to write code.

  By integrating with local data and applications, we hope that Terminus can become users' second brain in the future.

- **Decentralized Social Media**

  Users can install applications like Mastodon, Ghost, and WordPress on Terminus with a single click. This allows them to build their personal brand and interact directly with others without the risk of being banned or paying platform commissions.

- **DePin**

  Terminus offers comprehensive management of clusters, from computing and storage to networking. Projects can develop mining programs on Terminus, enabling users to share idle physical resources with the network and earn rewards.

  Although finding an effective proof of work in the physical world is challenging, we firmly believe that through the combination of [Snowinning Protocol](../snowinning/overview.md) and [Otmoic Protocol](../protocol/otmoic.md), Terminus will create a DePin network that users rely on daily.
