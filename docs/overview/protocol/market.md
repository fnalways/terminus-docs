# Open Application Distribution Protocol

## Concept

The vision of Open Application Distribution Protocol is to **create a permissionless application distribution ecosystem where user payments fully belong to the developer**.

## Tech solution

To realize this vision, technologically we need to acheive:

- Unified installation format

  Terminus provided [TAC format](../../developer/develop/package/chart.md), allowing users the same experience as installing and managing traditional applications, recommendation algorithms and models, and all future "software".

- Application Sandbox

  Terminus provides[Community Application Mode](../terminus/application.md#community-application) to minimize the impact of malware.

- Decentralized application evaluation system

  Terminus provides [Application Reputation](../snowinning/smart-contract.md#application-reputation) to help users make purchasing decisions and identify reputable developers. 

- Users can freely choose Indexer services for Market. The following figure shows the relationship between Developer, Indexer, and Market.

  Developer can freely submit applications to any Indexer, and Market can choose any Indexer to display the application list to users.

  [apps](https://github.com/beclab/apps) is the official Indexer of Terminus. It is automatically maintained by a Gitbot robot according to the rules. Developers only need to follow [the process](../../developer/develop/submit/index.md) to submit an application in line with the TAC format, Gitbot will merge the developer's submission into the trunk, and the user can see this app in [Market](../../how-to/terminus/market/index.md) and installed it.

  You can also refer to this case to build your own Indexer.
