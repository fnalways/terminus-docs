# Otmoic

## Introduction

Otmoic is a trustless automatic value exchanging protocol based on Snowinning Protocol, built for Depin, AI Agent, and Crypto Trading.

The vision of Otmoic is to **give public goods a fair price**.

Otmoic Protocol has the following features:

- Provides on-chain [reputation mechanism](../snowinning/concepts.md#reputation) for trader and liquidity provider, solving the free mint problem
- Supports [KYC](#kyc) based on [Verifiable Credential](../snowinning/concepts.md#verifiable-credential)
- RFQ-based price discovery
- Supports Atomic swap based on-chain transactions
- Supports automatic market making by liquidity providers through applications installation in Terminus OS

With the above design, Otmoic Protocol can be widely used in Depin, AI Bot, Creator Economy, Crypto Trading, Crypto Crossing Chain, Fiat And Crypto Gateway and other scenarios.

- About the operation duration limit of each step
  - transferOut: must be called before agreement_reached_time + 1 \* step_time_lock otherwise it will fail
  - transferIn: must be called before agreement_reached_time + 2 \* step_time_lock otherwise it will fail
  - confirmTransferOut:
    - if using the hashlock of transaction initiator, must be called before agreement_reached_time + 3 \* step_time_lock otherwise it will fail
    - if using the hashlock of the relay, must be called before agreement_reached_time + 6 \* step_time_lock otherwise it will fail
  - confirmTransferIn: must be called before agreement_reached_time + 5 \* step_time_lock otherwise it will fail
  - refundTransferOut: must be called after agreement_reached_time + 7 \* step_time_lock otherwise it will fail
  - refundTransferIn: must be called after agreement_reached_time + 7 \* step_time_lock otherwise it will fail

> [!NOTE]
> The expected normal operation process and time limit are:
>
> - transferOut: 1 \* step_time_lock
> - transferIn: 2 \* step_time_lock
> - confirmTransferOut: 3 \* step_time_lock
> - confirmTransferIn: 4 \* step_time_lock
>
> However, considering possible cheating on both sides, the time limits of confirmTransferOut and confirmTransferIn need to be adjusted.
>
> - If LP have not performed confirmTransferIn until 4 _ step_time_lock, the relay will perform the operation by itself. The duration 4 _ step_time_lock ~ 5 \* step_time_lock is for the relay to prevent cheating.
> - The hashlock used during transferIn is provided by the transaction initiator so relay will use the hashlock of itslef to perform confirmTransferOut if the transaction initiator perform confirmTransferIn near the time limit of 5 _ step_time_lock. The duration 5 _ step_time_lock ~ 6 \* step_time_lock is for the relay to prevent cheating.

- About Transaction signatures

  The transaction initiator should use the requestor to sign the transaction and the signature is filled in `user_sign` field.
  LP should use the address that has been verified by the DID contract to sign the transaction and the signature is filled in `lp_sign` field.

> [!NOTE]
> The signatures follow EIP-712 standard on EVM-compatible chains.
> The signatures follow supported similar protocols on other chains.

- About KYC Info

  Users need to provide their on-chain address when doing KYC with the relay. After KYC is done, the swap initiated with signature of this address will match the limiter with the state of successful KYC and provide complete KYC information like LP for confirmation. For more info see the chapter about KYC below.

- About The Lock Bit

  In the data returned to frontend, the Lock bit tells whether the agreement is reached and the tokens need to be locked. Its value is false in the following cases:

  > [!NOTE]
  >
  > - The recovered address calculated from user_sign and other swap information is different from the requestor address
  > - The recovered address calculated from lp_sign and other swap information have not been verified on-chain
  > - The transaction initiator does not satisfy the limits set in the quotation
  > - Other unknown reasons (e.g. the LP may reject this swap request in cases of insufficient balance or large price deviation)

  > [!NOTE] About hashlock
  >
  > - The transaction initiator provides bytes32 data as the lock for releasing tokens and will be verified by `keccak256(preimage)` during Confirm operation. The locked tokens are released if this is verified and other conditions are met.
  > - TransferIn uses the same lock as TransferOut.
  > - After publishing the preimage during ConfirmTransferOut, the LP can use the preimage to perform TransferIn.

### KYC

Use the TermiPass browser plugin to sign "Otmoic KYC Verifiable Credential Request Schema" and submit it to the relay. After manual review by managers of the relay, the system will issue "Otmoic KYC Verifiable Credential Schema" and synchronize the issued VC to TermiPass in the frontend, then submit "Otmoic KYC Presentation Definition" to the relay to finish KYC.
