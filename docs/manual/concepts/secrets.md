# Secrets


Olares categorizes `secrets` based on usage scenarios and employs various management techniques.

|                 | Data Type                                                                            | Storage Location                              | Leak Risk                                                                              | Usage                                                                                                                  |

## Integration credential

Users can enable applications within Olares to access external service credentials by [logging into third-party service accounts](../../how-to/olares/settings/integration.md#third-party-account) through Settings. Examples include:

- [Logging in to Olares Space](../terminus-space/manage-accounts.md#log-in-to-olares-space) allows the backup service to request tokens for automated backend backups.
- Logging into Google enables Files to synchronize with data from Google Drive.

Applications in Olares can retrieve these third-party service credentials via the [Service Provider](../../developer/develop/advanced/provider.md).

## Application credential

- Applications within Olares can manage and utilize [credentials](../../developer/develop/advanced/secret.md) via system-provided interfaces.
- Credentials generated by an application are exclusively restricted to that application's use.
