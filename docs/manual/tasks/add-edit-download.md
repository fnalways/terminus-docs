## Download files
When downloading multiple files, the behavior differs between the Files in Olares and LarePass desktop application.
* **Files in Olares (web interface)**: Automatically packages files into a zip file for download, requiring manual extraction.
* **LarePass desktop**: Downloads are queued, allowing you to pause, resume, or cancel tasks, and easily locate downloaded files.
