# Backup & Restore

Orales Space is the official solution to back up snapshots for your Olares instances. You can restore a Terminus to its most recent state whenever needed. This section provides instructions for managing backups and restores in Orales Space. 

:::tip
Each Terminus is provided with **10GB** of free backup space. Any usage beyond this will be charged according to the cloud provider's pricing.

## Restore Backup to the Terminus Space

![alt text](/images/how-to/space/restore_backup_to_the_terminus_space.jpg)

Restoring a snapshot to the cloud is similar to setting up a new **cloud-based Terminus.**

**Step 1: Set up relevant details**<br>
1. Select the cloud service provider and their data center location.
2. Choose the hardware configuration for the instance.
3. Confirm the snapshot details and enter the backup password.

**Step 2: Understand charges for storage and bandwidth**<br>
Each instance includes a certain amount of free storage and traffic. Any usage exceeding these quotas will incur charges.

**Step 3: Complete payment** <br>

1. Confirm the order and complete the payment.
2. The Terminus begins to install.

:::info NOTE
During the installation process, **Terminus**  will verify the backup password. If it is incorrect, you'll be asked to re-enter the correct one. If you forget the backup password, the restoration process won't be able to continue. In this case, please return your instance and try restoring again.

:::info NOTE
To avoid conflicts or other unforeseeable problem, you must return the existing Terminus that uses the same name before restoring to a **cloud-based Terminus**.

To restore a backup to a local Terminus:

1. Clicking the **Restore to Local** option. The **Restoration Guide** page opens.

:::info NOTE
You need to enter the backup password in the command line window to continue with the restoration. If you enter the wrong backup password, follow the instructions to retry.
